        It's just such a strange, strange concept. Have you ever tasted Elk
        heart? so good for you, one of the leanest meats. I've got some i'll
        give you it on the way out. Isn't it weird how your mind works in a
        totally different way under the influence of psychadelics... seeing
        patterns change and form and colours drip and merge and you know it's
        not real yet that is what you are actually seeing. Did you know that the
        pineal gland naturally produces DMT, your own body produces one of the
        strongest psychadelics known to man. How weird is that? Jaimie could you
        get that article up? We put a monetary on actual life itself.
